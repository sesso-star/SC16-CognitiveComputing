SC16 Introduction and Keynote Katherine Frase

- She works on the Watson
- How do we work with systems that helps us make the write questions and
  not just give the right answers.
- We are drowning in data: most of them, unstructured, with noise

- How de we get estatiscally significant data?

- Human computer interation
    - tabulated systems
    - programmable systems
- We are still teaching humans to speak a computer language

- What's different in a cogniteve system?
    1. it understand language the way humans do
    2. the system learns, rather than being programmed
    3. it can give different answers depending on the context

- 4 Points
    1. Understands
    2. Reason
    3. Learns
    4. Interact

- Think fast and slow
    - Slow thinking 
    - Fast thinking
    - example: saw someone. What's his name?
        - fast: it's bla.
        - slow: wait, is it? ... (1 hour later) it's blu!
    - We have a bias on our thoughts
        - we prefer information that reinforces what we already know.
    - We tend to overestimate probability of smth that already happen
      and underestimate probability of smth that did not happen.
    - We could "fix" these bias on cognitive computing

- Can we really build a cognitive system?
- There are trends that make it possible
    - Better machine Learning
        - Image recognition and speech recognition error decreased a lot on     
        2012 ~ present date
        - Why? We could raise size of the models.

    - Massive Datasets
        - Are all of these really data? What is signal and what is 
          noise?
        - Can you have a system that can pass the radiology test?
        - difficult even for humans
    - Improvements on performance and cost of computers
    - Investiments
- Why does it matter?
    
- Cognitive Computing in Oncology
    - How do we use a cognitive system to help physicians give find best
      treatment according to the patient.
    - We have to consider the workflow of not oonly the system, but also
       the human using the system.
    - Use case: 
        - persistent cough

- Another disease: heart failure
- Can you predict which patients will come back frequently once they had
  heart failure?

- Education Challenge
    - No data...
    - How can the teachers act accordingly to a child's need? It's easy
      when the child is brilliant or troubled, but how about the ones
      that are in the middle?
- Sesame + Watson
